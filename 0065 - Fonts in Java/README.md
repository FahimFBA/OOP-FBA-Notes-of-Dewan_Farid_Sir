In Java, Font class manages the font of Strings. 

The constructor of Font class takes three arguments: the font name, font style, and font size. 

The font name is any font currently supported by the system where the program is running such as standard Java fonts Monospaced, SansSerif, and Serif.

The font style is Font.PLAIN, Font.ITALIC, or Font.BOLD. 

Font styles can be used in combination such as: Font.ITALIC + Font.BOLD.
